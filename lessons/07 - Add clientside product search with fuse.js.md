# ðŸ““ Lesson 07: Add clientside product search with fuse.js

Now that we have our products, we want to give our customers a way to search for those products.

While we can manually look through a list of products to see if a product's title matches the search, we could instead use a library like [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) which gives us the power of fuzzy search, along with a lot of other capabilities, to easily add powerful clientside search.

## Getting Started

In this lesson, we'll learn how to search through our array of products based on a query to give customers a way to look for specific products.

To do that, we'll use node library fuse.js, which allows us to set up a new search instance that we'll make our queries to.
